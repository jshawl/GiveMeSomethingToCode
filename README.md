# Give Me Something To Code

Have some spare time and just want to code something and don't know what? Then [GiveMeSomethingToCode](http://theamazingweb.net/givemesomethingtocode) is for you. It displays random [dribbble](http://dribbble.com) shots that you could code. It suggests to create a Pen on [CodePen](http://codepen.io) so you can start right away and easily share your code.
